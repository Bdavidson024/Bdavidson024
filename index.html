        <li>What's up everybody? They call me the AutoKing, I'm a cannabis industry influencer</li>
        <br>
        <li>My hobbies include educating people about cannabis cultivation, being active in the cannabis community. I work at a hydroponics grow shop, as well as a hemp/cbd/delta8 shop in Kentucky. </li>
        <br>
        <li>I’m currently majoring Computer and Information Technology with a submajor in Programming at the local community college. I'll have my associates degree finished by Summer 2022 and I am extremely excited about getting into the workforce. Anyone
            that can drop some knowledge on me regarding jobs in the IT or networking fields world would be greatly appreciated.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Eventually, I want to create a few mobile apps, for the time being, though, I'll be working on my first website, KYAUTOKING.COM which will contain my blog (growers journal) along with product reviews, some grower's tutorials, it will have links
            to a couple of brand's websites that I am affiliate marketing for; my GO-TO cannabis seed bank, the #1 seed bank in existence in my opinion; my goal is to grow my audience and eventually grow my own brand; then design, market, and sell my
            brand's merchandise...gotta start somewhere, right?!!! Speaking of, click the link below!!</li>
