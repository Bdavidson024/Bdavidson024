       <li>Yo, what's up everybody? They call me the AutoKing, 31 years young, father to a beautifu 6-year-old, cannabis industry influencer</li>
     <br>
       <li>My hobbies include educating people about cannabis cultivation, being active in the cannabis community. I work at a hydroponics grow shop, as well as a    hemp/cbd/delta8 shop in Kentucky. </li>
     <br>
      <li>I’m currently majoring Computer and Information Technology with a submajor in Programming at the local community college. I'll have my associates degree finished by Summer 2022 and I am extremely excited about getting into the workforce. Anyone that can drop some knowledge on me regarding jobs in the IT or networking fields world would be greatly appreciated.</li>
     <br>
      <li>Eventually, I want to create a few Android apps that I'm confident will be successful and I cant believe they havn't been put out there by someone yet! At the moment, though, I'll be working on my first website,        KYAUTOKING.COM          which will contain my blog (growers journal) along with product reviews, some grower's tutorials, it will have links to a couple of brand's websites that I am affiliate marketing for; the first is my GO-TO cannabis seed bank, the #1 seed bank in existence in my opinion; and the other has the sickest gear in the cannabis industry, from hoodies to ashtrays and rolling trays. My goal is to finish school and grow my brand; then design, market, and sell my brand's merchandise...gotta start somewhere, right?!!! Speaking of...remember that seed bank?? Check them out below!!</li>
