       <li>Yo, what's up guys? 31 years young, father to a beautifu 6-year-old, cannabis industry influencer</li><br>
       <li>I’m interested in cannabis cultivation and being active in the growing cannabis community. I work at a hydroponic grow shop in Louisville, KY and 
      also a Hemp Dispensary.</li><br>
      <li>I’m currently majoring Computer and Information Technology with a submajor in Programming at the local community college. I'll have my associates degree
      finished by Summer 2022 and I am extremely excited about getting into the workforce. Anyone that can drop some knowledge on me regarding jobs in the IT or networking fields
      world would be greatly appreciated.</li><br>
      <li>Eventually, I want to create a few Android apps that I'm confident will be successful and I cant believe they havn't been put out there by someone yet! At the moment,
      though, I'll be working on my first website,        KYAUTOKING.COM          Which will contain my blog (growers journal) along with product reviews, some grower's tutorials,       it will have links to sites that have been absolute life savers for me(that way you guys dont have to struggle the way I did in certain aspects)such as the best             marijuana seed bank in existence and another site that has allllll the best gear from hoodies to ashtray lol scraig.  And eventually,hopefully, I can grow my name and my           brand and start selling my own merch and such...oneday...gotta start somewhere right!!! Speaking of...remember that seed bank I alluded to earlier?? check them out!!
