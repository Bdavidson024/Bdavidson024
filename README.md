- 👋 Hi, I’m Brad. 31 years young, father, cannabis industry influencer
- 👀 I’m interested in cannabis cultivation and being active in the growing cannabis community. I work at a hydroponic grow shop in Louisville, KY and 
      also at One Love Hemp Dispensary.
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring Computer and Information Technology with a submajor in Programming at the local community college. I'll have my associates degree
      finished by Summer 2022 and I am extremely excited about getting into the workforce. Anyone that can drop some knowledge on me regarding jobs in the IT or networking fields
      world would be greatly appreciated.
- 💞️ Eventually, I want to create a few Android apps that I'm confident will be successful and I cant believe they havn't been put out there by someone yet! At the       moment,
      though, I'll be working on my first website, and will gladly take any help and/or criticism in hopes to make me a better programmer.
- 📫 If you're looking to get in touch with me, feel free to email me anytime at kyautoking@kyautoking.com or DM me on my Instagram page, handle: the_kentucky_autoflower_king
