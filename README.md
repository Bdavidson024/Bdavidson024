- 👋 Hi, I’m Brad Davidson. 31 years young, father, cannabis industry influencer
- 👀 I’m interested in cannabis cultivation and being active in the growing community. I work at a hydroponic grow shop in Louisville, KY and 
      also at One Love Hemp Dispensary.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer and Information Technology with a concentration in Programming at Jefferson Community and Technical College. I should have 
      my Associates Degree finished by Summer 2022 and I am extremely excited about getting into the IT workforce. Anyone that can kick me some knowledge on finding a job in the IT 
      world would be greatly appreciated.
- 💞️ Eventually I will be looking to collaborate on some mobile apps that I'm confident will be successful and I cant believe they havn't been put out there by someone yet! At the moment,
      though, I'll be working on my first website, and will gladly take any help and/or criticism in hopes to make me a better programmer.
- 📫 If you're looking to get in touch with me, feel free to email me anytime at kyautoking@kyautoking.com or DM me on my Instagram page, handle: the_kentucky_autoflower_king
